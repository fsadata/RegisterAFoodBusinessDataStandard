# Register a Food Business Data Standard

This repository contains the documentation describing both the data standard and API documentation which should be used for registering a food business through the Food Standards Agency's online portal.

On 2020-12-03 the data specification split into v1 and v2, this was done to allow changes to be made and increase the services features, At present there is no set date to depreciate the v1 of the data standard and this will still be available. We do however strongly advise that any new integrations make use of version 2 and any existing integrations should migrate when possible.
